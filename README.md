## Streamlit COVID-19 Self Test App

The motivation for this project stems from the need to perform COVID-19 self test reporting to team members that will be visiting the office weekly.
This app tracks weekly self tests by each individual and visualises the different statuses of individuals on a chart along with the reported days that they will be visiting the office on.

> Note! For visitors, do know that streamlit temporarily freezes applications that are not frequently visited after a given time. For these instances, simply start-up the app in the same link provided
